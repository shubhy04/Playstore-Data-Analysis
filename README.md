# Playstore Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Playstore data, focusing on data cleaning, processing, and visualization. By leveraging powerful tools such as Databricks, PySpark, and SQL, this analysis explores various aspects of Playstore apps, including their categories, ratings, reviews, and installations. The goal is to provide actionable insights into app performance and trends in the Playstore market. 

> **Note:** This project is currently ongoing, and further enhancements and analysis are in progress.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Databricks**: For managing and processing large datasets in a distributed computing environment.
- **PySpark**: Utilized for scalable and efficient data transformations across large datasets.
- **SQL**: For querying, data manipulation, and generating insights.
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn for additional data manipulation and visualization tasks.

## Key Features
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Conducted thorough cleaning to remove duplicates, null values, and irrelevant data.
- Converted the data into appropriate formats for analysis, such as removing unnecessary characters from numerical fields like `Installs` and `Price`.
- Standardized the `Rating` column, ensuring that only valid ratings are included.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Performed scalable transformations using PySpark to handle the large volume of Playstore data efficiently.
- Used SQL queries within Databricks for efficient data aggregation and filtering.

### 3. Data Analysis
- **App Categories**: Analyzed the distribution of apps across various categories to identify the most popular and least represented categories.
- **Ratings and Reviews**: Explored the relationship between app ratings and the number of reviews, identifying trends in user engagement.
- **Installations**: Investigated the distribution of installations, identifying apps with the highest number of downloads and those struggling to gain traction.

### 4. Visualization
- Generated insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to depict key findings:
  - Distribution of app ratings.
  - Number of apps by category.
  - Trends in app installations across different categories.
  - Correlation between app ratings and the number of reviews.

## Insights (Ongoing)
- **App Categories**: The analysis is exploring the dominance of certain categories like 'Games' and 'Education' in terms of both app count and installations.
- **Ratings**: The project is currently examining the distribution of ratings and identifying patterns of user satisfaction.
- **Installations**: The analysis will continue to investigate the distribution and trends in app downloads, focusing on market leaders and emerging apps.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following tools installed on your system:
